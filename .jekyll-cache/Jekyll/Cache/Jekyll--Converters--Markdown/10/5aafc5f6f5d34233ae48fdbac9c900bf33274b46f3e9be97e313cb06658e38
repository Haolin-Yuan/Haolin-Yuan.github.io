I"™<p>We propose an MI attack , called BLINDMI, which probes the target model and extracts membership semantics via a novel approach, 
called differential comparison. The high-level idea is that BLINDMI first generates a dataset with nonmembers via transforming existing samples into new, 
and then differentially moves samples from a target dataset to the generated, non-member set in an iterative manner.</p>
