We designed and tested a proof-of-concept system called WebAlly, using Google reCAPTCHA as the task in a study with 10 pairs of a PVI adult and a friend or family member (18 in total).
We found that while WebAlly with friendsourcing requires interdependence, PVIs prefer it over using other time-consuming or low success-rate solutions, 
and expressed wanting to have WebAlly with crowdsourcing as a backup alternative. 
As for compensation, participants generally tend to compensate the helpers but have their own preferences in how to compensate. Participants also found that WebAlly did well in task performance and protecting their privacy and security. 
In addition, we found that WebAlly had a positive impact on their social relationship with the helpers
